      <b><i>You don't have to say a word,
Just seeing you was magic</b><i>
      <br>
     <i><b>FYI,</b>You exit in my world<br> 
In a way  no one does<br>
You are so, so special<br></i>
      </div>
      <div>
          <p> I got addicted to you so easily<br>
Attracted to you in ways that are hard to explain<br>
Everyday you're in my head<br>
When night falls and the world quites<br>
My mind doesn't<br>
It's filled with thoughts of you<br>
I lay awake wanting to talk to you<br>
You're the last whisper in my consciousness<br>
Before sleep claims me<br>
And my first thoughts when I wake<br>
This is how everyday goes<br>
I care about you more than you realize<br>
And I appreciate you more than you think<br>
Please tell me everytime our eyes meet<br>
You feel what I feel and tell me am not the only one<br>
Wide awake right now stuck in the trance wishing you were here<br>
Tell me am not the only one picking my phone every<br> minute of every night instead of sleeping<br>
Just waiting for you to let me  hear  your voice<br>
an all of your sweet thoughts<br>

        May not be able to give the moon<br>
But I'll eat you untill you see stars
